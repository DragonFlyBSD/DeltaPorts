GCC, the GNU Compiler Collection, supports a number of languages.
This port installs the GDC front ends as gdc9.

GDC is the GCC-based dlang compiler, integrating the open source dmd front end
with gcc as the backend. The GNU D Compiler (GDC) project was originally
started by David Friedman in 2004 until early 2007 when he disappeared from the
D scene, and was no longer able to maintain GDC. Following a revival attempt in
2008, GDC is now under the lead of Iain Buclaw who has been steering the
project since 2009 with the assistance of its contributors, without them the
project would not have been nearly as successful as it has been.

Any bugs or issues found with using GDC should be reported at the GCC bugzilla
site with the bug component set to `d`. For help with GDC, the D.gnu maillist-
list is the place to go with questions or problems. There's also a GDC IRC
channel at #d.gdc on FreeNode. Any questions which are related to
the D language, but not directly to the GDC compiler, can be asked in
the https://forum.dlang.org. You can find more information about D, including
example code, API documentation, tutorials and these forums at
the https://dlang.org website.
